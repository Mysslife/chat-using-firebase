# basic-chat-app-using-firebase-services

As I mentioned from the social project, I am quite curious about using firebase to generate realtime actions, and here is the basic chat app project that uses firebase to do it.

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A UNFINISHED PROJECT. ONLY BASIC FUNCTION IS SENDING MESSAGES AND IMAGES!

I find it easy to understand, but there are many new methods of firebase that I need to spend more time to learn.

I also deployed this project to my website at the link: mysslifechat.online

You can experience by creating 2 accounts and searching for the account's name in the search box, then start a conversation.

Thank you for reading and have a new day!
